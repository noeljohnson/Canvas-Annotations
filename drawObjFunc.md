`classMeta` is an object that stores the meta information of the classes that will be used during drawing. This object will be used to copy drawing objects and also to save these objects

Following are the keys of `classMeta`
* `obj` : Stores the drawing object on which classMeta's object methods will apply on
* `className` : This key stores another object, based on the className the values stored in this object will depend. Following are the keys of this object
  * `parentClass` : Contains the name of the parent class for the given `className`
  * `instVarC` : Contains the instance variables of the given class that need to store actual values when making copies
  * `instVarR` : Contains the instance variables that need to have references rather than copies as they all point to a single object
  * `setObj` : Is a function that returns a copy of `obj`

* `function transformPt(arr, offset, dim)` : The point return from the board say *(x, y)* have the following constraints

  * 0 ≤ x ≤ 1
  * 0 ≤ y ≤ 1

But when we need to draw a shape in the canvas, it need to have the actual integral co-ordinates used while calling. This method takes the given points in arr, add the offset to them and the scales them according to dim. The offset are also stored in the above co-ordinates. The points are stored in such a way so as to reduce the number of changes needed while doing various operations with the function.

* `function addPts(p1, p2)` : Does the vector addition of two two dimensional points

* `function scalePt(scale, p)` : Scales the 2d vector *p* by *scale* amount

* `function relLength(p1, p2)` : Finds the distance between the 2d points *p1* and *p2*

* `function addLinePoints(arr, p1, p2, delta)` : Generates points that lie in the line segment joining *p1* and *p2*. The points generated have are spaced by a delta relative distance. Also the points generated by this function is pushed to the *arr*

* `function rectLess(p1, p2)` : Returns *true* if *p1* is behind *p2* in a rectangular sense, else returns *false*

* `function rectMore(p1, p2)` : Returns *true* if *p1* is after *p2* in a rectangular sense, else returns *false*

* `function getIndex(arr, elem, f)` : If function *f* is undefined, it returns the first occurence of *elem* in *arr*, if *f* is defined, then it returns the first occurence, say *i*, such that *f(arr[i]) == elem*. If no such element is found, returns -1

* `function manip(val, offset)` : This function is used to increase the selection box dimensions when its generated using stroke select. The values are so set that their corners dont lie outside the canvas board

* `function drawFilledCircle(center, radius, ctx, color)` : draws a filled circle with corresponding parameters

* `function getTime()` : returns the epoch time in miliseconds

* `function setInstVarsCopy(oldObj, newObj, instVarNames)` : function to set instance variables by making copies, it is assumed that the instance variables are primitive or standard data types

* `function setInstVarsRef(oldObj, newObj, instVarNames)` : function to set instance variables to the same object as available in *oldObj*, that is they all refer to the same object whille set like this

* `function getObj(obj)` : This function is used to get a copy of a drawing object, it uses *classMeta* object to do so.
